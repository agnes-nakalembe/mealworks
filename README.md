Mealworx one page mockup website

For this project, we were asked to develop a one-page responsive website for a restaurant that serves healthy Food.
I first came up with a sitemap for what the site would look like and then proceeded to develop low-fi wireframes for the website page content and finally hi-fidelity wireframes.

With the hi-fi wireframes as my guide, I went ahead to the actual coding involving both the HTML and CSS to style my page. I used Visual Studio Code and included media queries within the CSS to make this site responsive to various devices like mobile, tablet, desktop.
